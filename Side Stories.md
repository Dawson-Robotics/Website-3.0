	**(Alice) Quote book ICONIC LINES**
	People can be described by many ways. One of my favourites is their quirky mannerisms and catchphrases! In spending so much time with your teammates, countless thoughts and ideas are exchanged through conversations which, at times, are hard to forget. With time, certain phrases and comical words make their way into conversations more and more. Whether it was an already established habit or newly acquired lingo, I think the Robotics Club’s phraseology deserves to be recorded and highlighted so that we can remember about the many funnies that happened and, ultimately, tease each other on our whimsical lines.

	**“Funding”**
	*within 3 days before website submission time*
	*'Brows not working properly*
	Friendly spy from another school: Just use a bolt cutter!
	Dawson guy: Our budget does not allow a bolt cutter.

	*flashbacks to when*
	New robotics member: What's our budget tho?
	(Capt n other older members): Haha uhhh, don't worry about that.
	Member: But we can't plan properly if we don't know the limits...
	Other: We will figure out something.
	Me (unconvinced): Okay…

	**Transaltion Fails**
	~~Slightly suspicious~~ Artistic word choices were made during the translation of the content 
	- The translation team :)
	Kyle: I never thought translation would be fun. Last year, I had to write everything alone and just pasted it in Google Translate. I found out about Antidote after it was over.
	Website person S *shows screen on past year website* look at the subtitle, like, the bar for the translation team is really low
	Website person Y: I’m sorry if what I wrote is making you guys lose brain cells, mine are kind of AFK too
	Various google searches and Google Translate is making us lose our minds while causing hysteria.

	**Shut the Algorithm Up**
	Website person Y: *finished writing the basic plot idea of self aware Matrix robot, asks around for people to recheck + make edits while inadvertently becoming the cause of loss of brain cells for fellow members* 
	*Rereads later*: wait why did this part get changed 

<img src=" " alt="google docs, very optional">

	Where is the more candid robot ;;-; it doesn't even have a sense of smell, how would it know it smells bad!? It originally was just wondering about the function of a mouth. 
	Website person S: didn't the AI have a super high intelligence, I mean, it trapped us all in a simulation. 
	Website person Y: yeah it's smart but it's dumb at the same time, like the robot didn't realize he'd need humans to change his batteries or fix the power outage, so he went for the dumber short term solution. 
	Website person S: so it's evil then? 	
	Website person Y: nooo it was trying to help but with the wrong method, like we share the same goal and all want to win, it's just more dumb since AI and also I'm not trying to write something that has higher intellect than me, it'd end badly. 
	Anyways I'm definitely changing it later (in the corner of writer's brain : if it weren't for the fact that the AI was a figment from my imagination, I'd wash its MOUTH with some soap, dammit)

	**(Alice) 3D printed spacer rant**
	For the double reverse 4 bar, to avoid friction between different VEX bars and between screws, gears, and bars, it was planned to use 3D printed spacers to space out the different pieces. At the beginning, a cheap pipe was used to prototype spacers by cutting them roughly to size. 3D printed spacers allow for precise length. However, because of the past disassociation of the Robotics Club and Mechanical Engineering Technology, we don't have easy access to their workshops, and by extension, our 3D printer! So we had to rely on James’ personal 3D printer which, not going to lie, did mess up prints often (the printer, not James)... Making changes was tedious already, but the changes in the arrangement of components mean that new spacers are required. Being a step ahead of design changes was difficult because of how hard foreseeing the new measurements for spacers was. Most of the time, when we wanted to tweak something, we had to wait for new spacers to be printed. To illustrate, to make sure the two arms move in sync, horizontal VEX bars were used to connect them. Problem: the holes from the VEX bars from the arms and from the ones for connection support did not line up. Solution: shift components with new spacers. In short, nothing fits.

	<h4>**ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS AGAIN, I KNOW THIS SECTION WILL HAVE MORE VISITS:**</h4>
	I would like to mention the participation of (practically) the whole team of Dawson Robotics in the making of this website. Thank you for being the storytellers, the witnesses, or the ones involved in every process described in this story. Another shoutout to the Translation team, thank you guys for going over the massive amount of content in such a short period of time, and to the website development team! Lastly, special mention: Kyle for being an amazing team lead, and doing his best to fix the countless glitches (caused by the robot, obviously) up till the very last minute!! I'm sure the website will look amazing~ Credit where credit is due, without everyone joining and working with the team, as a team, we wouldn't be here recording history. Thank you all for being here!!!!!!!!! And thank you to our readers~
