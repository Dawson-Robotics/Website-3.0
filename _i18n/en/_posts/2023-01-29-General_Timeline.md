We started our journey way before the start of the Avia competition, during the 2022 winter semester. Using the kiosk and the robot from the Arcanum competition, we had set up a gallery about the robotics team in the school to promote the Dawson SPACE program. Our dedicated members James, Kyle, Jason, Rowan, Jeff, Darcy, Trevor among others from the previous year had the opportunity to show off what had been created, and to share with the activities of the Robotics team with the other students at Dawson. In doing so, we were able to cultivate interest in the team, and as a result gain more members for this year's competition.

With the start of the Fall 2022 semester, that was the official time to start recruiting for the club. Thankfully, one of Dawson’s events was right around the corner, Club fair! Similarly to the gallery that was set up in the previous semester, posters were printed, the robot was taken out of its slumber, and we were once again advertising for more people to begin their robotics career. The exact number of additions are unknown, but the event was clearly a great success.

We thus officially start the semester with:
- **Power** (more people, because united we stand, divided we fall)
- **Funding**   
- **Influence** (more people, this is very important so we said it twice)

One of our first meetings had the goal to make a life changing decision: choosing a theme.

<video? battle of theme>

At this point, we unknowingly sealed our fates: we were bound to be trapped in the Dawtrix. It was but a matter of time.

After the theme was decided, the classroom of 7A2 (seventh floor) was generally divided as such for each team:
- Robot had around half the class, the innermost part of it with one whiteboard and one electronic board. They also had another smaller room serving as a workshop and storage room. The suffocating temperature however, has dissuaded most of us from staying for prolonged periods of time, so we eventually moved most of our activities into the classroom.
- Kiosk had a gathering closer to the door, second place in size. 
- Sandwiched between those two giant teams was the video, website, and programming teams. Although they came in last in terms of size, they made up for it through the amount of noise that came out of the group while brainstorming.

Kickoff happened. Dawson is pretty far from Laval, so the half of the team that lived closer to Villa-Maria were squeezed into one car, while the other half team found their own means to get there. Once at the place, James had to come find us at the door each time since we didn’t know where to go once we got to École Curé-Antoine Labelle. Writer(who’s here for the first time) entered near the end of the first Kahoot, about CRC history of competition. The second Kahoot was about the rules and just to brag, one of us got third place on the podium. CRC ran out of prizes though, so no plushies for us :’c. After some chatting with the other teams present, we learned of the fact that today's event was more of a socializing one: we'll be given a book with all the measurements.

As students, our biggest enemy is unironically, the entity granting us our identity: school. Amid the avalanche of assignments and the ultimate tsunami of final exams, we really didn't have the extra energy to focus on extracurricular activities, namely robotics. See you all next year~

Happy New Year!

We are back with our January grind schedules, 10AM to 5PM, Monday to Saturday, you work during vacations, no monetary wages, do you accept this job contract?

Apparently a lot of us are crazy, because that’s exactly what we did, and even working overtime seeing we’d end up leaving the school way after 6PM and had to climb fences to escape the ~~asylum~~ school. The counter for the record of the most amount of times one of our captains has told us to close up (then got ignored) is: 17. 
So here’s the second part of our progress: 

<img src="blank" alt="joke pic of the different times on screen">

With the vacational disappearance of the rest of the student body within Dawson, our behaviour became slightly… unrestrained. 
Playing our music loudly was the least we’ve done. We also kept the door open for ventilation, which is usually forbidden since we were rather loud. 
The screens were often displaying looped videos, ranging from cats to dancing skeletons. The most looped video was an orangutan driving through a zoo for 10 hours. It was not only looped on one screen, the team would put the video on both smartboards, or even better: 6 videos open on one device. They might have opened even more tabs if not for the fact that the mouse was already lagging with 6. 

<img src="blank" alt="any screen with orangutan">

On January 5th, the fish cult was born, and it spread to more and more members as the days went by. *(Writer Y declares being supportive of the spread of the fish cult, but denies ever joining it. Y remains a devout believer of Cats.)* 

<img src="blank" alt="fishe">

On January 7th, after having seen the *lack of living souls outside of Robotics members*, the girls in the Robotics club came to an agreement with the boys in order to obtain shared usage of the boys’ bathroom for handwashing purposes. The purpose for this agreement is convenience: the boys’ bathroom is adjacent to the team’s designated workspace, while the girls’ bathroom is much farther down the hall. The clause passed and thus, the girls were spared the tedious walk to and from the automated sinks. 

(Nathan) January 14th, the Tres Amigos Incident
After two weeks of the Dawson Robotics Club attending the college day in and out during the winter break, our captains decided that on Saturday January 14th, our last day of coming in before class started, we would all go out and share a good dinner together. After coming in at 10am, the 14 students who were left at 6pm to have this dinner left the school. Considering our late exit from school, we had to jump the fence because all the exits including the one leading to the metro were locked. After taking the metro to the original restaurant we intended on attending, we discovered that there was no room for 14 hungry robotics students. After this, we tried another two more places nearby, to no avail. We were beginning to lose hope, when one of the members called 3 Amigos and after initially hanging up on us, they said that they could house all 14 of us if we got there by around 7:15ish. At 7:20 we arrived at the Three Amigos. One problem stood in our way. We had made an error in our directions and went to the wrong one. This location had no room for us, so a walk in the snow and another metro ride later, we arrived at the intended Three Amigos at 7:40. Our table has been given to a different group as we arrived 25 minutes later than expected. We were made to wait for this table to clear up in the basement of the Three Amigos. There are no vibes quite like 13 (Robotics Member T had to leave to get rest for a ski lesson he was teaching the next morning) robotics students deep in the basement of a Three Amigos on a lovely Saturday night. At 8:15 our captain returns after stakeout of the table we were awaiting. He reported that he saw the bills being taken out and that it shouldn't be much longer before we got a table. 20 minutes later, they were still paying. At 9:00 we were finally seated, only half of us had glasses of water due to a “glass shortage”. After three hours since leaving school, the hungry band of robotics students proceeded to indulge in a night of eating ice cream with forks, ordering Texan steak at a Mexican restaurant, breaking the Three Amigos alligator figure by accident, coercing other people to try the "spicy red stuff" and watching the Jacksonville NFL team pull an insane comeback: winning 31-30 after being down 0-27.
	Above all though, it was a night of laughter and unforgettable circumstances.

The following information is purely speculation

We are unsure of the date at which the simulation started. The journal I've been keeping has a blank, so the writer is unsure of the timeline moving onward. All I know (personally) is that when we woke up, school had already started (there goes my course outline attendance...) and we only had a few days left to rush to complete the website and video. We also apologise if the timelines of the other categories are inaccurate, we’ve all been put through the grinder by the robot so none of our memories are accurate. We also apologise if there is anything glitchy or broken in the website, for the robot has done a lot of stuff without our knowledge... and we didn't have as much time to fix them all. 

Here are excerpts from the simulation’s journal:

Good evening, today is February, 2nd? Huh, that's odd... I remember it being January just yesterday. Time flies eh. Website and video should already have been submitted then, I guess the others probably fixed everything already and did an amazing job. Wait, so there actually isn't much point in me upkeeping the diary then? Hmm, I guess I got used to it though, anyways here's the rundown of the week: 

- The robot team is still working on fixing the double reverse 4 bar arm, they added a bunch of elastics and it seemed to be working better. 
- We went through (again, because what else is there to do at this point?) the pictures of everyone dressed in black and with sunglasses. Needless to say, we look absolutely stunning. Currently we are also turning a few pictures from the documentation channel into emotes. 
- The kiosk team is working on their LED lights, there’s an idea of using a Meta quest 2 VR headset. I don’t know what they’ll do but it sounds very cool. They seemed to always be the most organised of all of us & never to leave things for the last minute haha *looks away*. 
Days until competition: 14 

Hello again dairy, I haven't left to go buy milk yet, so today is February 9th. Last week, we made a lot of new progress:
- There have been advancements on the development of the elevator style mechanism (codename: transformers). There’s also a prototype for the claws that has been posted.
- The kiosk team has been gathering a lot of cardboard for a prototype phone booth, they also modified an office chair into something amazing. I think there are also posters being planned?
Days until competition: 7

**[End of data from simulation time]**

<img src="blank" alt="fade to black?">

And somewhere after that, we woke up, realised the time changed, and we’ve been too busy catching up and checking what the robot did.

The night before the submission, we saw the highest number of people in VC ever, we roped nearly everyone we could into writing content or translating, and the ones writing the code were very busy patching up the site. The voice call lasted until 11PM, but they were still planning on grinding tomorrow.

WEBSITE SUBMITTED, END OF JOURNAL. 

<h4>**ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:**</h4>

I would like to mention the participation of (practically) the whole team of Dawson Robotics in the making of this website. Thank you for being the storytellers, the witnesses, or the ones involved in every process described in this story. Another shoutout to the Translation team, thank you guys for going over the massive amount of content in such a short period of time, and to the website development team! Lastly, special mention: Kyle for being an amazing team lead, and doing his best to fix the countless glitches (caused by the robot, obviously) up till the very last minute!! I'm sure the website will look amazing~ Credit where credit is due, without everyone joining and working with the team, as a team, we wouldn't be here recording history. Thank you all for being here!!!!!!!!!
