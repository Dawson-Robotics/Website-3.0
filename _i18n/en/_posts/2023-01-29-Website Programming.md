To say that the website programming journey was long and challenging, it would be an understatement. As I reflect on the plans that we had scrapped, I knew that the website team, and per extension myself, could have done things more efficiently than what we have now.

For one thing, taking over our former website lead, Tim, was no easy feat. Going from the Arcanum website to Avia’s was going to be a lot of pressure, as Tim’s programming was way beyond my capabilities. As someone who just wrote the website content and translated it hastily, it was certainly a big step and I would need to step up my knowledge in web design. Luckily we now have more than two website members this time around, and even better we had Computer Science students, Izzy and Sila.

So web design skill was never an issue. Leadership was. I recalled one of our first meetings. I was presenting in front of a smart board, with not only our current team, but also prospective students looking into the robotics team as a whole. Having 40 souls looking at me while I try to explain the website competition (and also the programming competition) got on all my nerves. I was never a great presenter to begin with, this reached an all-time level of anxiety. The good news is that somehow I made it. Most were just interested in the robot aspect anyway, and Darcy, the video lead, took over to explain the video competition.

Once all this was done, I decided to continue using GitLab to host our website code, like last year’s website. Unlike GitHub, GitLab needed users to share their credit card information to use their runners, which seemed suspicious. At the same time, I did not have the hardware to support a runner. Luckily, Izzy had that covered. The problems didn’t end there, however; when the website was eventually created, we had issues with linking the files together. At that point, we were approaching January, with less than a month before the deadline. We then decided on GitHub, and after a few days troubleshooting we had a functioning website with CSS. My willingness to use GitLab was certainly to blame for the time crunch we had to endure before submission.

With that, pages were being made, website ideas were experimented, and our designs came to light. While we could strive to replicate Tim’s success, we decided on a conservative approach; no crazy robot spinning as we scroll (and blocking text) and by making the overall website easier on the hardware with scaled down images and videos. With the winter break, it made working on the website easier, although at this point Izzy was occasionally working on video with Darcy.

In summary, the website could have done better. I believe that we had done a lot on the programming side to make the website the way it is. I am looking forward to seeing how well our site performs compared to our competitors. This journey is certainly a step in the right direction, to learn and inspire web design creativity and to build some leadership and presenting skills personally.
