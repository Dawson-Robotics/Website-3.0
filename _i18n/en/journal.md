Our Progress

Before we were given the full rules for the competition, members from last year’s 
Dawson Robotics team were already working hard on recruiting new members to our team. At the Dawson Club Fair, we garnered plenty of new members. When asking on our Discord server about who wanted to be a part of the robotics team, over 100 people responded that they wanted to be a part of our robotics team. Even if only half of those people came to our meetings, that would still be over three times the amount of people on our team last year! Recruitment was successful, to say the least. And ideas were beginning to form for possible theme ideas, videos and robot designs. Plans on what to reuse from the previous robot, such as reusing its base, were underway too during this time.

Kickoff

And then, on November 7th, Kickoff finally happened. A small group of Dawson Robotics’ members, including both of our co-captains, ventured to École Curé-Antoine Labelle, where the game rules were finally revealed to all. The group was given the CRC Starter Kit and a Dimensions Guide, containing all the dimensions of each and every part of the field, including the game pieces. Now, it was up to the team’s ingenuity and creativity to create something functioning and wonderful.
