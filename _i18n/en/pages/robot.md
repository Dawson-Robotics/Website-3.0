The robot that is going to be used for this competition is going to be a four wheeled robot which has two arms. This robot is set to move in every direction and flip some hexagons to the color corresponding to our team (blue or yellow). It first consists of a base to which four wheels, each connected to a motor, are put on place, and we made sure that the wheels are big enough to keep the base at a high level so that the hexagons won't be an obstacle to the robot and that it could pass over them easily. The base is like a square and in the middle we added two bars to put on the wheels. On the base, the robot has an elevator mechanism. When we connect an arm to this elevator, this mechanism could help it to go at different heights and therefore reach different levels of the towers during the competition.
