<h3> What is CRC </h3>

Ever since 2001, the Canadian Robotics Competition has been a popular competition across Quebec, uniting high schools and cégeps together to learn about robotics, programming, web design, and so much more (including having a fun and nerdy social life). Every year has had a brand new competition, ranging to robots shooting tennis balls into bucket-like containers to earn points, to a teamwork competition where robots must interact with devices to obtain points. This year, CRC has created the Avia competition, where two teams of two robots compete to obtain points by flipping hexagonal pieces to their respective colour.

Avia Location
Just like the previous CRC competition, the Avia Competition takes place at the Laval-based high school, École Curé-Antoine Labelle. 


<h3> Game Rules </h3>
This year, Avia returns to the classic 2 versus 2 competitive format. This year, the two teams are labeled as the Blue Team and the Yellow Team. The goal, as always, is to be the team with the most points. Each team can obtain points by flipping the hexagonal game pieces to their respective team colour. Depending on where the game piece is placed, it will garner the team a different amount of points. Each level on the towers gives a different number of points. The following point system below shows the amount of points given to a team for each level on the towers and the ground/playing field floor:

<ul>
<li> Level 0 (Ground): 35 points </li>
<li>Level 1: 10 points </li>
<li>Level 2: 20 points </li>
<li>Level 3: 40 points </li>
<li>Level 4: 80 points </li>
<li>Level 5: 160 points </li>
<li>Level 6: 320 points </li>
<li>Level 7 (only found on the middle tower): 640 points </li>
</ul>


There are 59 normal game pieces (GPs) and one red game piece that are all scattered on the playing field. The red GP, when placed in a tower, nullifies all the points scored on the levels below it.

Sandwiched between the two starting points of the same team is the Multiplier. The Multiplier zone contains a triangular stand to stack GPs on. The team with the highest stack (with no outside help) gets their points multiplied by 1.5x. In the situation where both teams' towers have the same height (difference of 1/8 inches maximum), each team gets a x1.25 boost.
