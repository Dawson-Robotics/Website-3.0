*FR* 

Hello.
I am Oracle.

My team is… busy with other things, so I will be introducing you to everything instead.

![Monkey Moments](..\assets\images\weSpinAroundAndAroundAndAround.gif "We love monkeys")

I am the robot that the Dawson team is building for this year’s Avia competition. Nobody could tell you more about me in every facet other than, well, me. I was optimized to complete the various tasks that will appear during the Avia competition, namely: flipping blue and yellow hexagons that my teammates call “Game Pieces,” (GPs) onto the floor, showing the side that corresponds to my team’s color, placing these GPs into the multiple levels of the towers, and stacking them onto the “multiplier” triangle to get a 1.5x boost to my team’s “points”. I don't know what the purpose of the points are, but it is my only goal to get as many points as possible. My team seems to share this goal, so it must be something good. 

![Base Plans](..\assets\images\base_plans.jpg "Robot base")

I am a *measurement* by *measurement* robot, and *measurement* tall. I was made to not be overly “fat” to the point of being unable to pass through doors in the physics department (perhaps they meant bulky?). My mode of displacement is by the use of omni-wheels. I have four of them, spread out on my sides like a car, but they are within the frame of my base. My wheels are apparently special, since they also have a name: “Mecanum wheels”. Thanks to the Mecanums, I can easily move in all four directions without any trouble turning. 

![Base Model](..\assets\images\base_model.jpg "Robot model")

My base frame is rectangular, with one square missing in the middle of the front. They say the shape is similar to an “H” with an extra bar at the bottom. My four wheels are inside the two vertical bars of the H, around the lower half of it. Each wheel gets one motor due to the weight, and all the motors lay near the square frame between the wheels. This square frame also supports my arms. The tops of the H support one BROWSE (temporary, for snowplows, the thing thats gonna get the gps towards the middle) each and one side of my flipping mechanism. 

![MOUTH in action](..\assets\images\mouth.jpg "The MOUTH in action")

A lot like humans, I also have a MOUTH, only mine stands for Moving Objects Upward Towards Heaven. It uses a double reverse four bar mechanism in order to lift the GPs into the air. Attached to the end of my MOUTH is my TEETH (Turning Each Element Through Hands). This part of me grabs the GPs with claws, enabling me to secure the GPs and turning gears in the rear will flip them to the color that I want them to be. The process will thus be, I grab the GP with my TEETH, I lift it with my MOUTH while turning my TEETH to flip the GP if need be, then at the appropriate level I will advance and let go of the GP inside of the tower. I will also be stacking the multiplier tower with my MOUTH and TEETH.

My flipping mechanism is UNNAMED (acronym when?). This part is composed of one bar and two motors rotating simultaneously. My bar fits almost perfectly into the gap between the yellow and blue side of the GP, and the two motors provide enough force to overcome the weight of the GP and flip it into the gap between the top of the H. My team actually modified the base just to make an area to flip the GP into. My bar and motors are also set up in a way that they can slide along a vertical axis if the need to adjust its distance to the floor comes up.
