Video (Alice) Unironic Reflection of Camera in Glasses

	One of our main worries was the 5 minute limit for the video’s length. We had many good ideas, it was hard to cut them out of the script. Just a couple of days before the start of the shoot, our director Darcy had realized that using toy guns for the video at Dawson College was not the best idea, considering the school’s history. But Jason thought of a replacement for the toy guns (who were hexa-gone), which was just the start of the many bits that made it to the final video. While filming, many takes were required to obtain the best of the best shots. Of course, unintended laughing was permitted because of how HILARIOUS some of our lines were. Remember how our main obstacle was the fact that we had too many ideas? Well, that was until Darcy got Covid right after our night out! The timing was potentially fatal! But do not fret, this exact situation happened last year as well, so we totally have experience with handling this… While Darcy was out, progression was made on clip editing and special effects animation. In the final stretch, Darcy was back, we resumed recording for the voice-overs with paper roll mic set-ups and with empty classroom hunts. All in all, video production was one jumble of a ride even though our progression was very stable for the most part, following through with brainstorming, scripting, filming, and editing.

	If you ever get a chance to be in a video directed by Darcy, be on the lookout for his iconic lines:
	*“Let’s do it one last time for good luck”*
	*“Show me the funny”*
	*“OMG CANON”*
