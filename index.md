ON COMPUTER SCREEN so close it has no boundaries.

A blinding cursor pulses in the electric darkness like a heart coursing with phosphorous light, burning beneath the derma of black-neon glass.

A PHONE begins to RING, we hear it as though we were making the call. The cursor continues to throb, relentlessly patient, until --

MAN (V.O.)
Yeah?
Data now slashes across the screen, information flashing faster than we can read: "Call trans opt: received. 2-19-98 13:24:18 REC:Log>."

WOMAN (V.O.)
Is everything in place?
On screen: "Trace program: running."
We listen to the phone conversation as though we were on a third line. The man's name is Cypher. The woman, Trinity.

TRINITY (WOMANV.O.)
I said, is everything in place?
The entire screen with racing columns of numbers. Shimmering like green-electric rivers, they rush at a 10-digit phone number in the top corner.

CYPHER (MANV.O.)
You weren't supposed to relieve me.

TRINITY (V.O.)
I know but I felt like taking a shift.
The area code is identified. The first three numbers suddenly fixed, leaving only seven flowing columns.

CYPHER (V.O.)
You like him, don't you? You like watching him?

We begin MOVING TOWARD the screen, CLOSING IN as each digit is matched, one by one, snapping into place like the wheels of a slot machine.

TRINITY (V.O.)
Don't be ridiculous.

CYPHER (V.O.)
We're going to kill him. Do you understand that? He's going to die just like the others.

TRINITY (V.O.)
Morpheus believes he is the One.

Only two thin digits left.
CYPHER (V.O.)
Do you?

TRINITY (V.O.)
I-- it doesn't matter what I believe.

CYPHER (V.O.)
You don't, do you?

TRINITY (V.O.)
If you have something to say, I suggest you say it to Morpheus.

CYPHER (V.O.)
I intend to, believe me. Someone has to.

The final NUMBER POPS into place --
TRINITY (V.O.)
Did you hear that?

CYPHER (V.O.)
Hear what?

On screen: "Trace complete. Call origin: #312-555- 0690.
TRINITY (V.O.)
Are you sure this line is clean?

CYPHER (V.O.)
Yeah, 'course I'm sure.

We MOVE STILL CLOSER, the ELECTRIC HUM of the green NUMBERS GROWING into an ominous ROAR.
TRINITY (V.O.)
I better go.

She hangs up as we PASS THROUGH the numbers, entering the nether world of the computer screen. Suddenly, a flashlight cuts open the darkness and we find ourselves in --

INT. HEART O' THE CITY HOTEL - NIGHT
The hotel was abandoned after a fire licked its way across the polyester carpeting, destroying several rooms as it spooled soot up the walls and ceiling, leaving patterns of permanent shadow.
We FOLLOW four armed POLICE OFFICERS using flashlights as they creep down the blackened hall and ready themselves on either side of Room 303.
The biggest of them violently kicks in the door. The other cops pour in behind him, guns thrust before them.
BIG COP
Police! Freeze!

The room is almost devoid of furniture. There is a fold- up table and chair with a phone, a modem, and a powerbook computer. The only light in the room is the glow of the computer.
Sitting there, her hands still on the keyboard, is TRINITY; a woman in black leather.
BIG COP
Hands behind your head! Now! Do it!

She slowly puts her hands behind her head.

EXT. HEART O' THE CITY HOTEL - NIGHT
A black sedan with tinted windows glides in through the police cruisers. AGENT SMITH, AGENT BROWN, and AGENT JONES get out of the car.
They wear dark suits and sunglasses even at night. They are also always hardwired; small Secret Service earphones in one ear, the cord coiling back into their shirt collars.
AGENT SMITH
Lieutenant?

LIEUTENANT
Oh shit.

AGENT SMITH
Lieutenant, you were given specific orders --

LIEUTENANT
I'm just doing my job. You gimme that Juris-my dick-tion and you can cram it up your ass.

AGENT SMITH
The orders were for your protection.

The Lieutenant laughs.
LIEUTENANT
I think we can handle one little girl.

Agent Smith nods to Agent Brown as they start toward the hotel.
LIEUTENANT
I sent two units. They're bringing her down now.

AGENT SMITH
No, Lieutenant, your men are already dead.
