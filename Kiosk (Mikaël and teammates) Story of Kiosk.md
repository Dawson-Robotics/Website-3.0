Kiosk (Mikaël and teammates) Story of Kiosk
---

	At first, when the kiosk team just formed, few people knew each other and also didn’t know what the competition was. We all learnt what the kiosk was and its purpose from Jeff who did the competition previously and was essentially the leader of team Kiosk. During the first weeks, there was a lot of catching up to do for most of us. We looked at the material from the previous years to understand what we were trying to achieve. In addition, we had a notebook with comments and suggestions for how to do a good kiosk by a student who had graduated the previous year. Thankfully the people in the team were excited to learn and share ideas. Quickly, there were a few elements we knew we would integrate into our kiosk. We decided to have green LED and to paint the walls grey or black to mimic the aesthetic of the matrix. We also wanted to all wear trench-coats and have sunglasses. However, at this point, we hadn’t done any physical work.

	It’s only during the break that we started building different elements. We had different people working on different parts of the kiosk. Jeff, Rowan and Sarah worked on the coding and layout of the LED strips. At the same time, Kimia, Jasmine, Rozhina, Selina and Mika worked on the design for the matrix chair, ideas for posters and the spray painting of some wires. At the same time, Jeff got a rotary phone and we all theory crafted ways to use it. Coming to school to work on the kiosk really helped us all bond to each other: it allowed us to spend more time together and get to know each other. By now, a lot of the initial shyness people had towards each other vanished and we could all work properly as a team.

	When school restarted, it was a signal to us that we needed to start wrapping things up: there were going to be less days when the room we used was going to be available and the competition was approaching quickly. Kimia and Jasmine did great work finishing up the design on the matrix chair, and Jeff, Sara and Rowan finished the coding and wiring for the LEDs. Simona and Mika then planned, with the help of others, the design of a phone booth and then built the framework. Cardboard structures were also constructed by Jasmine to hold and diffuse the LED lights. During this time, Snigdha helped out all around in different tasks. Finally, Kimia, Jasmine and Rozhina did some last planning for the poster designs and other artistic elements around the kiosk. Throughout this project, everyone got to meet new, wonderful people and got to work on a variety of tasks for the creation of the kiosk. On their own, these tasks may not have been interesting, however the marvellous environment around us made it some of the most fun moments of cegep.
