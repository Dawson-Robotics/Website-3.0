Robot (James) Timeline-Robot

	**1. After Kickoff (November):**

	After kickoff, there were countless meetings that were dedicated to a giant accumulation of ideas and prototypes concerning the various challenges that were posed to us. We were able to surprisingly quickly deduce the main components of the robot, these mechanisms being:

		- The lift mechanism
		- The fast flipping mechanism
		- The base and drive train
		- The grabber for the game pieces

	Once the general outlook of this year's robot was determined, it was time to get ideas for the previously mentioned mechanisms. We had no trouble coming up with a lot of rather interesting mechanisms…

	Cats with wheels, a pancake flipper, broom and dustpan for the game pieces, you name it. With all the ideas that we came up with, some of them were bound to work. But at this point, it was still too early to tell, we hadn’t gotten to know our pieces quite as well as we would have hoped. 


	**2. Getting to know the pieces (December)**

	Now it was time to mix and match and see which ideas were the most feasible and effective. We spend a lot of December getting to know the different pieces and how everything works together. We were also able to narrow down what each of the different components were going to look like:

	**The lift mechanism (the Mouth)**

	The most effective lift mechanism that was agreed upon goes by the (long) name of a double reverse 4 bar, which relies on the concept that two parallel beams that are connected at the ends allow the connected bar to remain upright without changing its angle. We thought this to be necessary as the game pieces needed to be placed inside the towers while they are parallel to the ground.

	Here are images of the mechanism. In principle, by moving one of the green gears on either arm, the other one will move in the opposite direction as they are fixed to their respective bar. Therefore, we can establish a lifting arm mechanism whereby moving only one of the arms is capable of moving the other. Therefore this allows the mechanism to be fully compressed to get low to the ground, as well as extended to reach up as far as possible. Furthermore, at the end of the extended arm we have space to attach the grabber which will be used to clasp the game pieces from the floor.

	**The fast flipping mechanism (the Oracle)**

	The goal of this component on the robot is to act as a game piece lawn mower, capable of running around the playing field and flipping as many game pieces as possible. However, this was no easy feat. Seeing as the game field is quite large, and that we will be covering large distances, we needed a mechanism that did not require too much precision to flip a piece. The idea that we came up with took advantage of the flat playing field. The idea is having a bar that would hang at the height that slots into a game piece, and once inside the grooves of the piece would revolve around its own axis in order to grip the edges, and ultimately flip it. In addition, to make this mechanism require less precision when it comes to lining up the game piece, we decided to add a funnel-like system, which brings the game pieces to the mechanism by simply driving the robot forward.

	**The base and drive train**

	The base of the robot is a constantly evolving feature, taking many new forms and shapes before the one we have now. Since the game pieces were to be flipped inside the robot, the motors, wheels and general frame had to be adapted many times in order to have sufficient space for this to happen. The result, a general frame that looks like this:

	**The grabber (the Teeth)**

	The grabber was decided to be composed of two claws each attached to their respective gears, where one motor’s role is to move one of the gears thus closing the claw. It is composed of 4 3D printed components.

	The grabber is designed to also slot into the indent of the game pieces, which allow them to have a strong hold on the game pieces as they are being manipulated by the elevator.


	**3. January Grind**

	Here is where the main chunk of the work has been put in. It is through the January break where the true dedication of the team shined bright. In this time everyone got their hands dirty and got to work on creating the various mechanisms. Of course, this includes many reiterations of the initially presumed designs, and LOTS of trial and error. Spacing issues, parts that we don’t have, weird tools that are hard to use, only a couple of the many problems we ran into while making the components of the robot. What’s most important is that we persevered through the problems we encountered, and one by one found working solutions to (most) of the problems.
