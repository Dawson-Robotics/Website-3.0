Our Progress
Before we were given the full rules for the competition, members from last yearâ€™s 
Dawson Robotics team were already working hard on recruiting new members to our team. A
t the Dawson Club Fair, we garnered plenty of new members. When asking on our Discord 
server about who wanted to be a part of the robotics team, over 100 people responded that they 
wanted to be a part of our robotics team. Even if only half of those people came to our meetings, that 
would still be over three times the amount of people on our team last year! Recruitment was successful, to say the least. 
And ideas were beginning to form for possible theme ideas, videos and robot designs. Plans on what to reuse from the previous 
robot, such as reusing its base, were underway too during this time.
